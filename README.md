# si-units

The si-units C++ library provides type-safe calculations involving physical quantities that are measured in the units of the [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units).

si-units is a header-only library of template classes and functions that automatically convert quantities to the correct units when performing mathematical or relational operations. The library contains the class [`si::units_t`](docs/units_t.md) and its helper struct [`si::quantity_t`](docs/quantity_t.md).
